## Introduction
StudyNotion aims to provide a seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging. Additionally, the platform serves as a platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners globally.

In the following sections, we will cover the technical details of the platform, including the system architecture, API design, installation, usage instructions, and potential future enhancements.

## System Architecture
The StudyNotion EdTech platform consists of three main components: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front-end serving as the client and the back-end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end
The front-end of the platform is built using ReactJS, providing dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It communicates with the back-end using RESTful API calls.

#### Front End Pages
For **Students**:
- Homepage
- Course List
- Wishlist
- Cart Checkout
- Course Content
- User Details
- User Edit Details

For **Instructors**:
- Dashboard
- Insights
- Course Management Pages
- View and Edit Profile Details

### Back-end
The back-end is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front-end to interact with. It handles user authentication, course management, media storage, and payment processing.

#### Back-end Features:
- User Authentication and Authorization
- Course Management
- Payment Integration (Razorpay)
- Cloud-based Media Management (Cloudinary)
- Markdown Formatting for Course Content

#### Back-end Tools and Libraries:
- Node.js, Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Mongoose for database interaction

## Database
StudyNotion uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for data storage. The database schema includes models for students, instructors, and courses.

### Database Schema:
- **Student Schema**: name, email, password, course details
- **Instructor Schema**: name, email, password, course details
- **Course Schema**: course name, description, instructor details, media content
